# Slingy Game
Inspired by the game Flappy Bird with mechanical differences using ballistic curves.

## Project description
One day in 2017 going to bed I came up with an idea originating from Flappy Bird but instead having an object spinning while holding a button, and shooting the object out based on current position in the spin upon release.

To achieve this, gravity and ballistic curves was necessary, as the object would have to drop in a physically realistic way depending on how it exits the spinning state.

The project has been implemented with javascript utilizing the library p5.js.

## How to Run the project
- Clone the repository
- Open `index.html` in any browser

## How to Play
- Hold `space` to start spinning
- Release `space` to shoot
- Entering a gap in the procedural pipes results in 1 point
- Endure as long as possible
